Built a gradient descent-based inverse kinematics solver, optimizing joint movements to reach target poses without error.
Designed and tested Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) and Potential Fields planners, achieving obstacle avoidance
and efficient path finding across diverse environments, comparing performance metrics of success rate, runtime efficiency.
Developed and tested an algorithm to pick up static and dynamic blocks and stack them, using computer vision for block
detection and multithreading for optimization, achieving a 90% success rate in block retrieval from a rotating turntable. All the code used in this project is under the lib folder.
